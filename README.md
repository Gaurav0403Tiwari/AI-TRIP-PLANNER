Live Demo (Deployed Link)

Paste your deployed URL here:

➡https://travelplannerai.site/

After you deploy (Vercel/Netlify/Render), copy the final URL and replace the placeholder above. You can also add a badge:

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-Open%20App-blue)](https://YOUR-DEPLOYED-LINK.com)

Also paste the same link in:

GitHub repo About → Website field (right side panel)

README top section (above)

App config (frontend env variable):

Vite/React: add in .env → VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourapp.com

Next.js: add in .env.local → NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourapp.com

⚠️ If your frontend calls your own backend, ensure the API base URL is set. The deployed link of the app goes to the README & GitHub Website field. The API base URL goes into .env.
